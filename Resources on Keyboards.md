#Extending the project into my own territory

Adding resources here I have picked up during research. Ultimate goal is to build a dactyl manuform likely 5x6 with rotary encoders maybe one each side. Probably for scrolling purposes or something that allows me to switch screens more rapidly not sure yet but like the idea of rotary encoders.


Resources to date I have picked up that I use for learning about how to wire keyboards and different types of products you can work with.


https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3770166 - adapter for rotary encoder to fit cherry mx slot

https://github.com/victorlucachi/void_ergo - another ergo keyboard that uses 3.5mm jack

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4628137 - related to above

https://github.com/LouWii/ErgoMax - another ergo resource with 3.5mm linkage

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWC_8BOArzc - most detailed video seen to date (series, several hours)

https://github.com/carbonfet/dactyl-manuform // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpnDz8aXFjE - did not find this video/repo useful

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UerP5bxGL3c - best explanation found to date (props to this user for diode explanations) bonus part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLsgsmZssuk

https://thangs.com/ZackFreedman/DactylManuForm-5x6-Mechanical-Keyboard-10466 (original resource from Zack prompting the build)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0F8Mig40m0 - video from infinite offset was a good watch

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlHgEqLVYqA - should probably start a resources tab or something at this point lol. this was based off of Zacks video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkNGxM4LRKQ - explaining different types of keyboards for comparison and overview notes (I have never heard of 'shift' keys being referred to as function keys but damn if that doesn't make sense)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xmAIC0CmGM - Corne project build, has "TRRS jack" which is useful for comaprison on how we use our own jack connector. A pre built board makes this project seem much MUCH easier. also there are some keycap snaps that make it look much easier to hot swap the keycaps as and when you want to as opposed to de soldering them. looks dope.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgEkusmH-9k - interesting life story here and resources shared on programming the keyboard like vimium looks interesting for reducing mouse requirements.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhu3s1ut3wM - not keyboard related but the wiring at crtain points had some interesting takeaways which helped clarify some points for me when doing the wiring

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiwUjLaebuw - topic of keybinds and how to lay them out. discussion on other typing types as well.
