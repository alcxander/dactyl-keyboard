# Keyboard Diary

## using this to track progression on keyboard creation

finding it difficult to find any clear and concise details about how exactly to wire up a dactyl manuform keyboard or even another ergodox, surprising amount of people with pre built chip boards and not hand wired. Bit of a pain, only one or two diagrams seems to accomodate the whole keyboard niche group. Namely

Started looking up QMK and how to flash the drive with it. Did not get the Arduino Pro Micro ended up getting another chipset [entirely](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07DF5CPTB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) there is a requirement mentioned that these chipsets need to be 'ATmega32u4' to check this you can find it on the chip (the black square chip) printed faintly. TODO: put image here locating wording sought.
